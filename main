World,Us
==========

Recommend:
World, Us. 
It's better firstly think about it yourself and give your description.

metadata
-------------
+ Representation rules?
Here we use natural language, which is a historily built symbol system with semantics to Reality.
We also can switch to alterntives, some new designed machine representationsof world.

+ concrete representation/description?
following.

General
-----------------
The world is a big system.We are parts of them.
As victory creature, humans, we use language to representate, science to explore and engineering to create.

But don't limited to humans's pattern.


how to describe?
--------------
+ Our descriptions is based on our specific observtions and our specific representations , whether for specics or persons.  

+ [world]   -----> sensor [input] --------->  [representation nets]
-------->  [action]
understand in fact sensor,actor has internal representation and could be trained.

+ we create some symbol/languages to describe them and build more abstractionsand combination like 'culture', 'happy', 'management' ,number, math-theory,etc.

+ we have neural nets to hold and understand these representations.But also these languges and knowledge has internal structs not limited to neural nets.modern times we'll recreate new representaions of world.

Descriptions
---------------
So far, humans've creted so many science (also no-science) topics.They all describe sth, may be a concrete physcial object , a class of objects, some created tools, even science 、creation 、languages self and other abstractions(you can regard all as objects.everything is a object, is it?) ， whatever.

Modern computing technology give ensential and much more possibilties to desriptions beyond traditional methods. 

Now many technology's doing some data-reprenstation work of real-world objects including concrete big data, natural language, traditional abstractions.

Here is a problem, for us, when our understanding of world changed so much, in fact, many traditional abstractions should be updated.When the world should iteration gradually, i want to imagine there and a path there first!


####Examples

Main.essays =SOME=
--------------
historily and futurly, i will share short essays.

I'm sure all my essays have great meanings not only in contens'
sematic, but its value to be carried out and big influence.

In fact, i'll implement myslef.You may find it in my github.

Main.glossary =NONE=
---------------
Here should be a glossary.md for reference.

Other sub-parts
-------------
to be added.

External
--------------
of course there are many center with more descriptions of every word/object.
like dictionary, wikipedia,Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, etc.
