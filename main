World,Us
==========

World, Us. Just think about it.

Use less words to achieve more complete descriptions.
+ How to describe these objects, i mean how?
+ Descriptions, like what are they, how they work?

General
-----------------
The world is a big system.We are parts of them.
we use langauge and science to describe the world.
And we make engineering to create some new.

how to describe?
--------------
Our descriptions is fundemtal on our specific observtions and our specific structions,whether for specics or persons.
we get observations by what world like and our perception struct.
we create some symbol/languages to describe them and build more abstractionslike 'culture', 'happy', 'management'.
we have neural nets to hold and understand these representations.these languges and knowledge has internal structs.and we use science to keep these descriptions more correct.

Descriptions
---------------
we've creted so many science (also no-science).they all describe sth, may be a concrete physcial object , a class of objects, some created tools, even science , creation , languages self and other abstractions(of course you can regard all as objects.everything is a object, is it?).. No end.

These main objects deserve to understand.

####Examples
1. how to restruct our language?how to make sure that description is good?
2. what is science?or say how to design definition of science which suits our understanding, how to design process of it and more?
3. what is human?
4. what is truth?
5. what is Significance, like Significance of life?
6. what is engineering?

Main.essays =SOME=
--------------
I have write some essays to combine some ideas, historically:)
you can review it for some understandings.

Main.glossary =NONE=
---------------
It is a complete but limited with size representation try.
refer to glossary.md

External
--------------
of course there are many center with more descriptions of every word/object.
like dictionary, wikipedia,Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, etc.
